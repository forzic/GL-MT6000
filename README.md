# GL-MT6000 custom OpenWrt firmware builder

This repository automates the process of building OpenWrt custom firmware images for **MY** Flint 2 (GL-MT6000) router, based on [pesa1234](https://github.com/pesa1234)'s work and **MY PREFERENCES**.

You should not use the firmwares released in this repository unless you have the same preferences.
Instead, make a fork and adapt to your needs.

Read [this topic](https://forum.openwrt.org/t/mt6000-custom-build-with-luci-and-some-optimization-kernel-6-12-x/185241) in OpenWrt's forum to learn the details about pesa1234's customizations.

This firmware adds:
- **WiFi UCODE scripts** (faster boot)
- **Wireguard VPN**
- **Policy Based Routing** (select what goes through VPN and what not)
- **AdBlock Fast** (ads and malware blocking at DNS level)

And also:
- odhcp, upnp, iptables, dnsmasq_full_dhcpv6 packages **REMOVED** 
- IPv6 disabled. Check the content of [`sysctl.conf`](files/etc/sysctl.conf).
- Some compiler optimizations and build hardening options (cortex-a53 + crc + crypto; LTO, MOLD, MKLIBS, and more). Check the content of [`mt6000.config`](mt6000.config).
- SSH configuration with strong algorithms and key exchange methods. Check the content of [`ssh_hardening.config`](files/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/ssh_hardening.conf).
- Quality-of-life enhancements through UCI configuration. Check the content of [`999-QOL_config`](files/etc/uci-defaults/999-QOL_config).
- Some debug stuff removed.


## SSH Hardening

To enhance the security of SSH connections, the project includes a hardened SSH configuration. The configuration is derived from recommendations by [SSH-Audit](https://github.com/jtesta/ssh-audit) and the [BSI](https://www.bsi.bund.de/), it specifies strong key exchange algorithms, ciphers, message authentication codes (MACs), host key algorithms, and public key algorithms. This ensures that only secure and up-to-date algorithms are used for SSH communication.
